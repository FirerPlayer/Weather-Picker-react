# Weather-Picker-react
A web application with a cool frontend, that show the current temperature in the location that user can choice. Completely desenvolve with React.js, Tailwind CSS and HTML. The purpose of this project is to practice react.js and frontend technics, such web desing, making svg files, positioning web elements and making things look nice.

This aplicattion consume a Weather API, where we can get temperatures, locations and a useful autocomplete list. This web site has autocomplete search made using react and jsx with their own logic. So, I learned so much doing this "simple" web site, like doing things with react framework, making animations, how to use tailwind css and what is babel and webpack. How to properly consume an external API? Come on, I literally can do this now.

The deploy was made in Netlify, using the plataform advantages. The link of the website is <a href="https://fp-weatherpicker.netlify.app/">here</a>.
